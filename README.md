# Project Title
A system to facilitate warning alert message in a state by monitoring the change in satellite images

## Introduction
Main idea is to monitor any change in the images and predict the risk of disasters. For example changes in sea behavior may imply arrival of tsunami, or change in steap slops may indicate landslide

In this, we will create a ML based solution to monitor the sea behavior and create a system which facilitates warning messages to the state.
