# Project Title
A system to facilitate extreme weather condition related warning or alert messages in a state by monitoring the change in weather data available at weather forecast agencies.

## Introduction
Our main idea is to monitor any drastic change in current weather data available with weather forecast agencies and predict the chances of upcoming extreme weather conditions. For example, comparision of existing rainfall related parameter patterns and current rainfall parameter values can suggest upcoming flood or drought.

In this project, we will create a Data mining and Machine Learning based solution to monitor the change in weather data available at weather forecast agencies and create a web based system which will automatically send warning messages to the concerned state agencies, newspapers and radio-tv channels for broadcasting it to the local public and will also flash on a dedicated web page.
