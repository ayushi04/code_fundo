# Project Title
A system to facilitate extreme weather condition related warning or alert messages in a state by monitoring the change in weather data available at weather forecast agencies.

## Introduction
Our main idea is to monitor any drastic change in current weather data available with weather forecast agencies and predict the chances of upcoming extreme weather conditions. For example, comparision of existing rainfall related parameter patterns and current rainfall parameter values can suggest upcoming flood or drought.

In this project, we will create a Data mining and Machine Learning based solution to monitor the change in weather data available at weather forecast agencies and create a web based system which will automatically send warning messages to the concerned state agencies, newspapers and radio-tv channels for broadcasting it to the local public and will also flash on a dedicated web page.

We will use frequent pattern mining to find the normal and special weather data patterns in terms of the weather parameter values used for weather forecasting by weather forecast agencies. We will dynamically keep updating these patterns and will store them for quick reference and comparision with the current parameter values. We will define threshold values on comparision scores which will help us predict normal/special cases.

While doing frequent pattern mining we will first filter out the dominating parameters to be used with high weightage and non-required parameters to be used with low weightage or to be simply ignored. We will apply associative classification to do this parameter filtering.
